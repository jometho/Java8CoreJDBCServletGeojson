# Java8CoreJDBCServletGeojson
Emmiting Geojson via Servlet 3.0 using Java Core, JDBC and JSONObject to serialize ArrayList of Pojos to GeoJSon.

This peoject uses Servlet 3.0 to serve the Geo(JSON) data that is fetched from postgres with JDBC queries from PostgreSQL. The Result of the quesries which is ArrayListof Pojos is transformed to GeoJSon with JSOnObject library without using a  third party geojson library for the transmformation. 
One of my early Java Core project, code style maybe crappy but don't mind!
